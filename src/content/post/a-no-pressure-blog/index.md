I [already have a blog](https://blog.mib.im/). And I have had that blog for a long time. Before
that, I had other blogs.
[The first blog started in 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051228074801/http://mikaelb.net/)
(hopefully you're not able to read Norwegian). There is some good content out there I think. Some in
Norwegian, some specific to a co-founded business of mine, and some detailed posts on programming
concepts and languages.

But over the years, the posts I write for work about business development or information posts have
gotten more and more frequent, and the posts I write solely for myself have become less so. I don't
know why that is, but at some point, I think I started thinking I had to have some sort of message
for every blog post I wrote â€“ the usual illusion of grandeur stuff.

Here is the thing though; I like writing. But I need to reset some structures and expectations for
myself on writing stuff. Now I'm making it sound like I am
[the next Jon Fosse](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2023/fosse/facts/). I'm not. Nor
am I a very gifted writer. But I enjoy it and I often use it as an activity of leisure. So like so
many before me, I aim to fix this adaptive mental problem, with a technical one. I'm starting this
new blog. On this blog, I will write whatever technical or social thing that comes to mind, without
any expectations on quality or message. Who knows. Maybe I'll even post the photographs that I'm the
least unhappy with.

**Take it for what it is; A no-pressure blog.**

_A side note:_ _This blog was created in [Astro](https://astro.dev) and set up with low effort using
one of many great templates linked to on the Astro documentation page. The one I'm using now is
called [`astro-theme-resume`](https://github.com/srleom/astro-theme-resume) and is again based on
other templates and designs. See the [Github repo](https://github.com/mikaelbr/mib.im) for the full
list of credits._
