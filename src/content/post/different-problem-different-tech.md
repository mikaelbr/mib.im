  'Dont pretend we all solve the same problem. Different problems require different solutions
  especially when it comes to web apps and content-driven web page.'

One of the biggest problems with strategic technology choices in the frontend world today is
straight-up [cargo cult-ing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming). Believing that
FAANG problems are our problems. Or that FAANG-scale is me-scale. Or even that "if it works for
them, it sure as hell will work for me". And yes. It might work for you. If you have the same
problem. But almost none of us does.

Yet, we listen to the dev-rels and advocates of the world; saying that we need to scale for the
hockey stick or be able to support the Venture Capitalist unicorn dream. But for what I do every
day, this is rarely a problem.

The result of this in my mind, is that we think there is only one problem to solve. And thus, the
problem we have is the same as the ultimate problem that the internet celebs have. And if we have
the same problem, we should also implement the same solution. The logic is sound, but it is also
false.

So, it turns out we have different problems.
[All these advice are context-less advice](https://medium.com/variant-as/contextless-technical-advice-no-more-6c9af5c58c08).
Either being technical ones, like the need for scale, flexibility, longevity, maintainability,
growability, speed, etc. There are many parameters we can optimize when implementing a new system.
All are important in their own way, but not all are important all the time for all circumstances. We
**have** to take into account what problem we are actually trying to solve.

## Web app vs Content-driven web page

The simplest but least talked about difference, in my mind, is whether your solution is a web app or
a content-driven web page. At some point, when the technology advanced and we were able to do proper
apps distributed by the web, we forgot that there is still something called a web page.

The reason I think this is a problem is that we _can_ technically use the same tech to solve this
problem, but the complexity and the return on investment is widely different.
