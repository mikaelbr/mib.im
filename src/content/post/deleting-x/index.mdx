Last week, I felt some hope on the internet again. I saw several people starting to use Bluesky, and
only then did I actually realize how much Twitter had deteriorated to a shit hole. Yes, I've known
it wasn’t as good as before, but I hadn't realized that I actively disliked it. With a passion.

Filled with ads, bots, hate. Nothing like why I loved it before: learning new things from people
around the world. It felt like the worst party you've ever been to. And you stayed until the end.
People lying around, sleeping, yelling at each other, someone fighting in the corner. And you only
stay out of fear of missing out. But you know you should have left a long time ago, and you have
nothing to gain by staying. I needed to be shown an alternative. And that alternative was Bluesky.

Bluesky feels like Twitter from 8 years ago. People interacting in a positive way, people sharing
things they’re genuinely excited about. Generally, a more positive feeling. And it rubs off on me.
Already, I feel more positive about technology again.

Instead of losing hope, I feel somewhat inspired by the internet again. Thanks, people on Bluesky!
