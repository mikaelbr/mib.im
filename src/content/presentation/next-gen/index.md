Contrary to popular belief, the frontend scene has actually been relatively stagnant for the longest time. On a macro level, we've largely followed the same patterns and architectures with only minor variations for the past 6-7 years. This is about to change.

After a period of stability, we see a significant shift in how we approach and solve problems. And what types of problems we solve.

Let's go through some of the biggest and most important changes to architecture, tooling, and patterns in frontend that are happening today and tomorrow. Let's also take a technical deep dive into how they actually work so we can gain a clear understanding of when to use them and for what problems. We'll look at different solutions such as Qwik, Astro, Edge Functions, Solid.js, and many more.
